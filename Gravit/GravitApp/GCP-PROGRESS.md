# Gravit Code Progress

## Completed Features
- [2025-09-04] Fix iPhone Header/Footer Colors: Resolved issue with white/different colored header and footer areas on iPhone 14 by implementing proper StatusBar and SafeAreaView configuration with black background (#141414)
- [2025-09-04] Fix React Fragment Styling Error: Resolved "Invalid prop style supplied to React.Fragment" error by replacing styled fragments with proper View components in LoginRegisterScreen
- [2025-09-04] Codebase Simplification & Optimization: Removed unused components (7 files), consolidated theme files, simplified LoginRegisterScreen with reusable components (InputField, SocialLoginButtons), and improved overall code structure
- [2025-09-04] File Structure Audit & Cleanup: Removed mixed directory structure, deleted redundant files including old fitness_design_system.json, and organized project according to React Native/Expo conventions
- [2025-09-04] Theme System Standardization: Eliminated fitness_design_system.json redundancy and established src/constants/theme.json as the single source of truth for all styling

### Key Design Patterns
- **Component Reusability**: Extracted common UI elements (InputField, SocialLoginButtons) into reusable components
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a clear, focused purpose
- **Theme Consistency**: All styling uses tokens from theme.json
- **Clean Imports**: Barrel exports for organized imports
- **Expo Router**: File-based routing system

### Performance Optimizations
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Removed 7 unused components and redundant files
- **Simplified Component Structure**: Broke down large components into smaller, manageable pieces
- **Consistent Styling**: Using theme tokens reduces style recalculations
- **Proper SafeAreaView**: Ensures full screen coverage on all devices

## Next Milestones
### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
- Implement additional authentication screens (Forgot Password, Email Verification)
- Create core navigation structure with bottom tabs
- Develop Home screen with workout overview
- Add basic form validation and error handling

### Medium-term (1-2 months)
- Implement workout programs section
- Create progress tracking features
- Add profile management
- Integrate with Firebase backend

### Long-term (3+ months)
- Implement offline capabilities
- Add social features and community
- Create advanced analytics dashboard
- Optimize for various screen sizes and devices

## Ongoing Simplicity Standards
### Code Simplicity Rules
- Keep components under 200 lines when possible
- Use clear, descriptive variable/function names
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3-4 levels)
- Prefer composition over complex inheritance
- Remove dead code and unused imports regularly

### Complexity Prevention
- One component = one responsibility
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks
- Use theme tokens instead of hardcoded values
- Keep props interfaces minimal and focused
- Avoid over-abstraction - prefer explicit code

### Regular Maintenance
- Weekly code review for simplicity
- Remove any accumulated complexity
- Refactor components that grow too large
- Keep dependencies minimal and up-to-date
